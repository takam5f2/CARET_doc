# Configuration

CARET requires several kinds of information for visualization.
Configuration set up the information needed for visualization.

Some of the information can be configured via Python API and jupyter, but there are also items that require direct modification of the architecture file.

For the format of the architecture file, see [architecture file](./architecture_file.md) for the format of the architecture file.
