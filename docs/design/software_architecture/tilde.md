# TILDE, a framework tools to detect deadline overrun

CARET can cooperate with TILDE, a framework tool to detect deadline overrun.
TILDE lets CARET trace events in user applications which cannot be traced from ROS/DDS layer.

Since ROS nodes can implement arbitrary processing, some nodes are difficult to calculate node latency.

Examples of implementations for which node latency is difficult to calculate are as follows.

- Message buffering case between subscribe and publish
- Using message filter case

the latencies can be observed in only application layer, but CARET cannot observe the events.

On the other hand, TILDE can trace application-layer events.
It is able to trace execution of callback function to consume a certain buffered message since it annotate message consumption per single message.

TILDE serves CARET this capability to trace consumption of buffered messages.
